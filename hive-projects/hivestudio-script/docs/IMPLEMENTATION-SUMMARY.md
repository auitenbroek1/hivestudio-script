   ```bash
   hivestudio-install
   ```
   - Leverages Claude's intelligence
   - Handles complex installation tasks
   - Provides contextual error recovery
   - Validates complete setup

## Technical Implementation

The two-stage installation architecture successfully separates concerns while maximizing the benefits of Claude Code's intelligence. Stage 1 provides robust system preparation, while Stage 2 leverages AI capabilities for complex installation tasks. This approach significantly increases installation success rates while providing an excellent user experience.

The implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for HiveStudio's intelligent development ecosystem.
